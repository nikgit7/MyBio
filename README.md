# MyBio
After completing my bachelor's of engineering, I started my career as an AutoCAD designer. After working there for a couple of years I realised that in this domain I am not growing. There I developed interest in IT and started searching about DevOps. I am currently doing an internship in DevOps and really enjoying it. IT is such a vast field and in itself it is an ocean of opportunities.
